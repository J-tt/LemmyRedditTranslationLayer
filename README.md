# Lemmy Reddit Translation Layer

This project aims to bridge the Lemmy API with the Reddit API, such that existing Reddit clients can be easily made compatible with Lemmy.

For best results, it should be run alongside a Lemmy instance for that particular client (currently).

## Status

This is a very early iteration of the software, it's heavily reliant on packages for the Reddit API and the Lemmy API. It currently supports **read only** access.
